Drifting through her days in Seoul, the eighth-grader feels like an outsider everywhere: at school, where her classmates bore her even more than the schoolwork, and at home, where her parents are always at each other''s throats and her brother beats her.


        With visual precision, Kim Bo-ra weaves a dense narrative around a regular summer that leaves nothing unchanged.'

The film is a portrait of a generation for whom ambition is devoid of meaning.  They lament the fact that everything has already been invented before their appearance, already done for them.  The main characters justify their irresponsibility and infantile behaviour by the lack of communication with their parents.   But their principal agony is that they grew up without fathers, and now the time is ripe for them to do things and achieve the status of adult males.'

    filmSynopsis: 'In 1964, while on a short trip to Paris, the American writer and art-lover James Lord is asked by his friend, the world-renowned artist Alberto Giacometti, to sit for a portrait. The process, Giacometti assures Lord, will take only a few days. Flattered and intrigued, Lord agrees.

        "Final Portrait” is a bewitching portrait of a genius, and of a friendship between two men who are utterly different, yet increasingly bonded through a single, ever-evolving act of creativity. It is a film which shines a light on the artistic process itself, by turns exhilarating, exasperating and bewildering, questioning whether the gift of a great artist is a blessing or a curse.'
