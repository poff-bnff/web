synopsis: >-
    "Acid” is an ode to youth, a film about today’s 20-year-olds who are
    entering the real world for the first time, and becoming conscious of their
    role within it.  The film is a portrait of a generation for whom ambition is
    devoid of meaning.  They lament the fact that everything has already been
    invented before their appearance, already done for them.  The main
    characters justify their irresponsibility and infantile behaviour by the
    lack of communication with their parents.   But their principal agony is
    that they grew up without fathers, and now the time is ripe for them to do
    things and achieve the status of adult males.
