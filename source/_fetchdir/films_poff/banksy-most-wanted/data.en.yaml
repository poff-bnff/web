synopsis: >-
    Banksy is a household name, but behind this name hides a multitude of
    stories, artworks, stunts, political statements and identities, leading to
    one of the art world’s biggest unanswered questions- who is Banksy?

    Thanks to his anonymity people have been able, for more than 25 years, to
    claim his work, either legally or emotionally, and to fantasize about who is
    hiding behind this name.
