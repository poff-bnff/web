synopsis: >-
    Korea, 1994. The South is in the grips of FIFA World Cup fever, while the
    North mourns its newly deceased dictator. Eun-hee registers all of this only
    in passing. Drifting through her days in Seoul, the eighth-grader feels like
    an outsider everywhere: at school, where her classmates bore her even more
    than the schoolwork, and at home, where her parents are always at each
    other's throats and her brother beats her.


    With visual precision, Kim Bo-ra weaves a dense narrative around a regular
    summer that leaves nothing unchanged.
