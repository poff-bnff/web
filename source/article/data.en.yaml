        The festival will be available online throughout Estonia'

    articleContents: 'The Robin Hood of the art world aka Banksy, Marcel Duchamp, Alberto Giacometti, Maud Lewis – these are the heroes of the features and documentary films on art topics, that will reach audiences in Tartu at the physical event taking place from the 10th until the 15th of August and also available online throughout Estonia. The full programme of the 15th Tartu Love Film Festival will be announced on the 30th of July.


        According to the new head of the festival Kristiina Reidolv, the topic of art is not only relevant in the context of Tartu''s aspirations towards art as a city and due to the recent anniversaries – art school Pallas turned 100 last year and Tartu Art Museum turns 80 this year – but in a wider context.


        "We want to raise art into the societal role as an instigator of social processes and as the philosophical trailblazer. Tartu is getting ready to become the European Capital of Culture (in 2024) and its banner "The Art of Survival" is socially and ecologically more relevant than ever before", she commented.


        The art programme will be opened by the fresh documentary Banksy: Most Wanted that has screened only at a handful of times globally after it world premiere at the online edition of Tribeca. Aurélia Rouvier''s and Seamus Haley''s film is seeking answers to why the world-famous artist won''t reveal his identity, creating an extremely engaging portrait of the artist / social warrior.


        In 1964, sculptor Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966) asked critic James Lord to pose for him for a portrait. It turned out to be an intense series of 18 meetings, during which the critic had a chance to learn about the artistic and emotional turmoil of one of the most well-known sculptors of the 20th century. Stanley Tucci''s Final Portrait is an insightful depiction of this session, that produced the last finished artwork of the artist (played by Geoffrey Rush) who died two years later.


        Aisling Walsh''s Maudie is a first deeper introduction into the life of Canadian Naïve art painter Maude Lewis (1903-1970), who, despite having her body deformed by arthritis, painted, with astonishing enthusiasm flowers, animals and butterlies. These paintings covered the house where she lived in poor conditions with her husband. Sally Hawkins, who''s made a unforgettable role as Maude, has received numerous awards for her role. Her husband is portrayed by Ethan Hawke.


        Marel Duchamp is without doubt one of the most influential modernists and artists of the 20th century. Matthew Taylor''s documentary Marcel Duchamp: Art of the Possible offers a thorough insight into his legacy and influence on the evolution of art, which has been commented on by creative minds such as Jeff Koons, Marina Abramović, David Bowie and many others.


        In addition to the film screenings, Tartuff will see a series of art-themed events, including exhibitions. performances, symposiums and excursions. The programme is organised in cooperation with Tartu Art Museum, Tartu Art College, Estonian National Museum, Voronja Gallery, street art festival Stencibility and many others.'

    articleContents: "It’s a rainy summer’s day. Tartu’s Townhall Square is colored in dimmed pastels. From one small alleyway, streaks of pink and red light up. Walking closer, a large street artwork is revealed. Roses, thorns and barbed wire on both walls create a dramatic, immersive tunnel effect. \n\nThe flowers symbolize rebirth, according to the artist Stina Leek, who made the art work live this week, in commission of Tartuff and Tartu’s street art festival Stencibilty. What she hopes for people, who enter the tunnel, is to experience this rebirth in themselves and maybe; to rediscover a part of themselves that had been missing. Just as she did herself, when she started making street art.\n\nWe sat down with artist Stina Leek (28) and Kadri Lind (30), organizer of Stencibility, to talk about the magic of street art and the street art scene in Tartu and Estonia. \n\n<strong>How did street art bring you back to your true self?</strong>\nStina Leek: “I started doing street art when I was 14. But then I got into a relationship, which wasn’t good for me. I lost touch with myself and stopped expressing myself creatively. A few years back I got fed up with living a life that didn’t feel like my own. \n\nI ended some relationships and got into making street art again. Stencibility gave me the chance to make several bigger street art works. Now, my whole life has changed. I only do what I feel passionate about; I make art, organize art events, edit an underground culture magazine and try to also create opportunities for other artists through these platforms. \n\nDoing street art for me, is like getting to play for a living. I wish I could tell everyone; that it’s all possible! You just have to concur your own fears and insecurities.\"  \n\n<strong>Is playfulness inherent to street art?</strong>\nKadri Lind: “As a street artist, you know that your work could be gone in two days or it could stay on a wall for two years. This street art ‘rule’ of temporality forces you to live in the moment and not attach to a work too much. I think those parameters can contribute to being more playful.\" \n\nMaking street art also comes with the adventure of secrecy (when a work is not commissioned). I have the most fun memories; like traveling to small villages at night with other street artists and having to jump into the road ditch when a car passed.\" \n\nSL: “Because a lot of the street artists remain anonymous, the subculture is also very close-knit. There’s just a small group of people you can share your experiences with. The street art community, therefor, rather than colleagues or competitors, feels like family to me.\"  \n\n<strong>How do you see the role of the street artist in the urban environment?</strong>\nSL: “As opposed to working on paper, as a street artist I feel there is a bigger significance and responsibility to my work. My work has to fit into the urban environment, work together with it or enhance it. I like to work with contrast. I recently painted a green wall which had paint coming off it, next to a car repair shop. The big, pink flowers I painted create an interesting dialogue. The vibe of the dusty, mechanical environment is enhanced, but so is the artwork. \n\nWhen I do quick graffiti’s, I like to spray small flowers in unexpected places. So, people, who walk by, will hopefully be pleasantly surprised by a flower peeking out from behind the corner of a building.\"\n\nKL: “I got into street art because of my studies in Ethnology. I decided to do my thesis on street art and its subculture. Later, I did a Master’s degree in Urbanology. During my studies, I read a lot of academic texts on the urban space and how its design effects the inhabitants of a city.\n\nLater, when I became friends with street artists themselves, the thing that struck me the most was that these artists said the same things as the scientists, without ever having read their texts: that the urban environment is felt as an extension of our personal space. How it is designed is crucial for humans to feel at home in a city. The street artist’s role in this, is to make our common living room colorful and playful.\" \n\n<strong>Why is it important to create legal opportunities for street artists?</strong>\nKL: “So they can compete with internationally acclaimed artists. Otherwise the same artists, who already have visibility, will be booked to make wall pieces in cities around the world. This will create homogenous urban environments, instead of unique and personal feeling cities.\" \n\n<strong>What makes Tartu a good place for street art?</strong>\nKL: “I think Tartu is a safe, homely environment. Street artist feel at ease here to create works. Of course, they don’t want to get a fine, but they don’t have to be worried to be harassed while doing their work. The streets of Tartu feel pleasantly still at night. \n\nIn Tallinn, for example, there is a bigger threat from authorities and from competing street artists. That’s why you see more graffiti there, which takes less time to create.\"\n\nSL: “Stencibility plays a big part in making Tartu’s street art scene so great! They create legal opportunities for street artists. This creates room for goodwill from the audience and gives the artist the chance to make bigger works, which you can really take the time for.\"\n\nKL: “We hope other places in Estonia will follow our lead. This spring we had a national fundraiser – which let people from all over Estonia invite street artists to make works in their city or offer their own wall as a site for an art work.\""

    articleSlug: actress-suvi-blick-to-move-past-a-culture-of-harassment-we-should-practice-empathy-
    articleLead: Force of Habit reveals the hidden way in which power is exercised on women. In private life and in society. The feature film is a collage of six short fictional films, directed by different female directors who draw from own experience and real life. The films achieve to depict the absurdity in moments that we have learnt to see as normal.

    articleContents: "The film is part of a bigger project: Yksittäistapaus, which came to life in 2016 – even before the rise of the #MeToo-movement. Created collectively by fifteen filmmakers, artists, researchers and social influencers it is comprised of eleven short films, the feature length film Force of Habit, free discussion material and a campaign. Just before Force of Habit screened at Tartuff, we sat down for a talk with one of the six main actresses, Suvi Blick. \n\n<strong>The myth of the singular case</strong>\n\nBlick plays Emmi in the short film Boudoir, which is directed and written by Reetta Aalto. After a house party, Emmi goes to bed. Just as she is about to sleep, her old classmate Jani (Joonas Snellman) comes in and asks to stay the night. Emmi lets him sleep on her floor, but Jani doesn’t really plan on sleeping. \n\nYksittäistapaus. How does this word translate to English? Blick doesn’t have an immediate answer. We exchange some suggestions back and forth: exception, singular case…all descriptions that are given to try to diminish the experience of victims of harassment. The translation that Google Translate comes up with is the most striking: isolated case. Since it doesn’t only reflect on the meaning of the word, but also the feeling of isolation that comes with experiencing harassment. \n\n<strong>\"You think it’s normal, yet you feel ashamed\"</strong>\n\nThe stories in Force of Habit are depictions of small moments happening all around us, but not seen. At least; not always seen for their harmfulness. Or maybe it’s the moments that don’t want to be seen. For you can easily imagine some of the perpetrators in the film would not act in the same way, would there be a bigger audience to their actions. \n\nBlick: \"As the title says, the existence of these instances is made possible by our force of habit. It’s much more a problem of the society as a whole, than of singular perpetrators. I also used to think that being catcalled in the streets was just a part of life as a woman. You think it’s normal. But you feel ashamed. And this creates an isolated state, because you don’t feel empowered to articulate your feelings of discomfort.\n\nSince making this film, I have become much more aware. Now I think: hell no, it’s not acceptable to receive remarks on your body from other people on the streets.\" \n\n<strong>\"Shame, discomfort and harm are in many more subtleties, than just the obvious\"</strong>\n\nBy showing the unseen in all its closeness and absurdity, as Force of Habit does so well, we get closer to recognizing harm. \"I was shocked by how many viewers admitted to having experienced something similar as Emmi,\" says Blick. What makes the subject difficult to talk about, according to Blick, is that it’s not all black and white. Every situation is different. \n\nBlick: \"You cannot say, as the male character Jani says in Boudoir: But, I didn’t rape you. The shame, discomfort and harm are in many more subtleties than the obvious. Also, they are much more something that is felt, rather than described by certain parameters.\" \n\n<strong>\"The element of absurdity is needed to reach people, instead of attacking them\"</strong>\n\nBlick hopes that people who watch the film will start to dig into their own life experiences and ask themselves; when was I in a situation that did not feel quite right and how can I act differently next time? \"This, of course, goes for men and women,\" says Blick. \"Neither the film nor the #MeToo-movement should be about pointing fingers and blaming.\" \n\nIn the film, the element of absurdity helps to create enough distance to be able to review our own actions, rather than to feel victimized or attacked. Blick thinks that the solution lies in empathy: \"Instead of prosecuting cases or people, we should collectively work on being more empathetic and open to each other’s experiences and feelings. Empathy should be taught in schools.\""
