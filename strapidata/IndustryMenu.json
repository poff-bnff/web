          "contents_en": "TV Beats Forum, a part of [Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival](https://poff.ee/) is the newest addition to the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event conference. The forum reacts to the real demand of the industry as a drama series’ market takes over and the need, for content by global streaming platforms increases. Local stories can travel universally as language barriers are no longer a problem and authenticity rules over generic and universal.\n\nTV Beats Forum is the place to meet the key international players in the region. Starting from small steps from 2018, with a one-day programme, we have an aim to build a drama series co-production market in the coming years. The forum’s prime objective is to inspire and facilitate the entry of regional producers and service providers into the international series co-production industry. With this in mind, TV Beats Forum explores global success stories from multinational productions. Scriptwriters, directors, composers, producers will share their experience as well as tips and tricks for creating a successful drama series. During the event, participants get a comprehensive overview of industry trends and are invited to attend a range of masterclasses. The organisers also make the best of local original formats available by presenting a catalogue of the most successful works.\n\n\n#### 2020 Programme\n\n**Thursday 26 November**\n\n10:00 (EET) **Welcoming words** by Wendy Mitchell, Marge Liiske and Jevgeni Supin\n\n10:05 – 10:25 **How Has COVID Impacted Global Production?**\n\nHow Has COVID Impacted Global Production? // Leading analytics company Ampere Analysis shares new research about how the pandemic has influenced film and TV shoots in Europe and beyond in 2020, and what the forecast is for 2021. *Guy Bisson, Research Director, Ampere Analysis*\n\n10:30 – 11:15 **New Solutions: Producing and Co-Producing in the COVID Era**\n\nProducers from across Europe discuss how they have had to adapt their productions to meet pandemic safety measures, as well as how they have found new solutions to financing and co-producing in 2020 and beyond.
