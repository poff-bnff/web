A supermarket security guard struggles through nested elevated-genre plotlines and inventive set pieces.\n\n“The look of the film gives a sense of submersion, disorientation and of diving deep into the subconscious.”\n (Wendy Ide, Screen Daily) \n\nAfter watching and experiencing CORTEX in the dark on the big screen you will be reminded of why we will always need movie theaters in our lives. A place where dreams truly come true – almost.  \n\nDirector of photography Thomas W. Kiennast (THE DARK VALLEY, 3 DAYS IN QUIBERON) and Philipp Orgassa (Lead Colorist ARRI Media) discuss the magic and technique of creating a visually stunning and mind-bending psychological thriller with a little help from post production. \n\nIn collaboration with ARRI Media.\n",

Despite not being able to earn a living solely through puppeteering, Craig loves his profession as it allows him to inhabit the skin of others. He begins to take the ability to inhabit the skin of others to the next level when he is forced to take a job as a file clerk for the off-kilter LesterCorp, located on the five-foot tall 7½ floor of a Manhattan office building. Behind one of the filing cabinets in his work area, Craig finds a hidden door which he learns is a portal into the mind of John Malkovich, the visit through the portal which lasts fifteen minutes after which the person is spit into a ditch next to the New Jersey Turnpike. Craig is fascinated by the meaning of life associated with this finding. Lotte's trips through the portal make her evaluate her own self. And the confident Maxine Lund, one of Craig's co-workers who he tells about the portal if only because he is attracted to her, thinks that it is a money making opportunity in selling trips into Malkovich's mind after office hours for $200 a visit. Craig, Lotte and Maxine begin to understand that anyone entering the portal has the ability to control Malkovich's mind, which also alters his entire being. This experience makes Maxine fall in love with a composite. This ability to control Malkovich's mind begs the question of the ultimate psychedelic trip for Malkovich himself, who begins to feel that something is not right in the world as he knows it.",

Having emerged to the level of story editor, he burnt out quickly and left after 4 years of hard labour. Based on his experiences, he wrote a book on TV writing and was subsequently invited to teach scriptwriting and dramaturgy at various institutions, among them the University of Theatre and Film Arts in Budapest. In 2006, he co-founded a script consulting firm and spent the following years as a hired gun, doing script editing and writing.\nGabor was offered the job of script development executive at the fledgling Local Original Production department at the Budapest office of HBO Europe in 2010. He later became the Creative Executive, responsible for all creative aspects of development and production on all Hungarian HBO shows as a producer, the latest being the third season of Golden Life, a crime thriller/family drama. In this role, he had also assisted in the launch of original production for HBO Europe in the Adria region.\nAfter leaving HBO at the end of 2018, Gabor went on to found his own company, Joyrider, specializing in creating and developing high-end scripted serial content for the international market.",

Subsequently, Ben became Assistant to the Creative Director and he’d only recently made the leap to Junior Script Editor when a show he was assisting on was greenlit by ITV/PBS.\nThis show was Mr Selfridge (10x60). Ben became part of the original creative team that set up the series and its writers' room alongside creator Andrew Davies. He went on to oversee the script process on all four seasons as Script Editor/Executive, eventually writing his own episode in the final season.\nSoon after, Ben worked with show-runner Kate Brooke to set up contemporary crime thriller Bancroft (4x60 for ITV) which ran for two seasons. Ben was Script Executive/Story Consultant and co-wrote three episodes with Kate across both seasons.\nAs Development Executive, Ben recently oversaw the development and story of Sarah Williams' family mystery drama Flesh and Blood, starring Imelda Staunton, which premiered this February on ITV1. Most recently, he wrote an episode of Kate O'Riordan's new Channel 5 psychological drama Penance, which became one of the highest-rated dramas ever on the channel in March 2020.",

Boundaries have shifted as the content platforms are getting more and more accessible - cinemas, festival screenings, TV, streaming platforms and Internet. In some countries the limiting of visual content is not specifically regulated, yet in other countries it is.\nIn the panel we will raise some important questions…\n\n- what are the limitations for youth films nowadays\n- is suitability for children and youth essentially a matter of opinion and depends on personal expectations and definitions of childhood\n- has the social media and streaming platforms affected the boundaries\n- how important is cultural pretext in defining youth film\n \nPanel discussion takes place in cooperation with Just Film Festival and ECFA (European Children's Film Association)\n",

What makes it even more challenging is that a good brand nowadays is about so much more than people just remembering your name. A good brand identity should communicate your entire essence, your history, your personal story, and values all at once.  \n\nAt the online seminar, she will talk about the basics of brand identity and trends in both marketing and presentation, bringing practical examples from both film and startup worlds.
