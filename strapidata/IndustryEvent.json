A supermarket security guard struggles through nested elevated-genre plotlines and inventive set pieces.\n\n“The look of the film gives a sense of submersion, disorientation and of diving deep into the subconscious.”\n (Wendy Ide, Screen Daily) \n\nAfter watching and experiencing CORTEX in the dark on the big screen you will be reminded of why we will always need movie theaters in our lives. A place where dreams truly come true – almost.  \n\nDirector of photography Thomas W. Kiennast (THE DARK VALLEY, 3 DAYS IN QUIBERON) and Philipp Orgassa (Lead Colorist ARRI Media) discuss the magic and technique of creating a visually stunning and mind-bending psychological thriller with a little help from post production. \n\nIn collaboration with ARRI Media.\n\nSpeakers: Thomas W.

    "description": "At youth film festivals controversial films ofter raise the questions - which audience should be allowed to see which films or if these films should have age restrictions. Boundaries have shifted as the content platforms are getting more and more accessible - cinemas, festival screenings, TV, streaming platforms and Internet. In some countries the limiting of visual content is not specifically regulated, yet in other countries it is.\nIn the panel we will raise some important questions…\n\n- what are the limitations for youth films nowadays\n- is suitability for children and youth essentially a matter of opinion and depends on personal expectations and definitions of childhood\n- has the social media and streaming platforms affected the boundaries\n- how important is cultural pretext in defining youth film\n \nPanel discussion takes place in cooperation with Just Film Festival and ECFA (European Children's Film Association)\n\n\nSpeakers: Jorge Cuchi, Maciej Jakubczyk, Kätriin Helena Huttunen\nModerator: Per Eriksson\n",

She also highlights the practicalities for Baltics rights holders, including outreach to platforms, the role of middle-persons, and deals / financials. She also turns to new productions: including digital co-pro and Originals trends, as well newer production formats (short form series, VR / cross platform, etc)\n\nLecture will be divided in two 1.5 hour parts, with a break in between and the following Q&A.\nCo-organised with the Creative Europe MEDIA Desk Estonia.",

    "description": "Writing for Virtual Reality is a practical workshop in which participants learn the challenges of writing for cinematic virtual reality and develop a 1-page script.\nThe aim of this workshop is to generate more awareness about the possibilities of the medium and to increase the number of screenwriters that are interested in creating stories for 360° media including VR, XR, and AR in the future. Although immersive media traces back to the last century, there is little practical literature for writers interested in participating in this medium.\nAna Falcon will be the moderator for this event. The workshop was created as part of her current research in Virtual Reality screenwriting methodologies. She was selected for the 2008 Fusion Arts Exchange in Screenwriting and Film Production hosted by the University of Southern California and the US State Department. In 2017, she was distinguished with a Young Creators FONCA grant from the Mexican Culture Ministry. In 2019, she was a screenwriting finalist in the Watersprite International Student Film Festival hosted by the University of Cambridge.\nIn addition to their 1-page, guests will be requested to participate in several practical activities designed to sensibilize them to the challenges of virtual reality including POV, cues, and technological limitations.",

        "aboutText": "In 1999, Gabor heard the siren call of TV drama and ended up on the writing staff of a daily soap at Grundy UFA. Having emerged to the level of story editor, he burnt out quickly and left after 4 years of hard labour. Based on his experiences, he wrote a book on TV writing and was subsequently invited to teach scriptwriting and dramaturgy at various institutions, among them the University of Theatre and Film Arts in Budapest. In 2006, he co-founded a script consulting firm and spent the following years as a hired gun, doing script editing and writing.\nGabor was offered the job of script development executive at the fledgling Local Original Production department at the Budapest office of HBO Europe in 2010. He later became the Creative Executive, responsible for all creative aspects of development and production on all Hungarian HBO shows as a producer, the latest being the third season of Golden Life, a crime thriller/family drama. In this role, he had also assisted in the launch of original production for HBO Europe in the Adria region.\nAfter leaving HBO at the end of 2018, Gabor went on to found his own company, Joyrider, specializing in creating and developing high-end scripted serial content for the international market.",

        "aboutText": "After studying drama at Bristol University, Ben’s first industry job was as a runner at ITV Studios Drama. Subsequently, Ben became Assistant to the Creative Director and he’d only recently made the leap to Junior Script Editor when a show he was assisting on was greenlit by ITV/PBS.\nThis show was Mr Selfridge (10x60). Ben became part of the original creative team that set up the series and its writers' room alongside creator Andrew Davies. He went on to oversee the script process on all four seasons as Script Editor/Executive, eventually writing his own episode in the final season.\nSoon after, Ben worked with show-runner Kate Brooke to set up contemporary crime thriller Bancroft (4x60 for ITV) which ran for two seasons. Ben was Script Executive/Story Consultant and co-wrote three episodes with Kate across both seasons.\nAs Development Executive, Ben recently oversaw the development and story of Sarah Williams' family mystery drama Flesh and Blood, starring Imelda Staunton, which premiered this February on ITV1. Most recently, he wrote an episode of Kate O'Riordan's new Channel 5 psychological drama Penance, which became one of the highest-rated dramas ever on the channel in March 2020.",
