What makes it even more challenging is that a good brand nowadays is about so much more than people just remembering your name. A good brand identity should communicate your entire essence, your history, your personal story, and values all at once.\n\nAt the online seminar, she will talk about the basics of brand identity and trends in both marketing and presentation, bringing practical examples from both film and startup worlds.\n\n**Join the masterclass at 16:00 (EET)** [here](https://industry.poff.ee/events/p-oe-ff-black-room-tallinn-creative-incubator-seminar/)",
