    "synopsis": "Austria, the end of the 19th century. The eccentric young Habsburg Archduchess Erzsi is a\nfixture of the most influential salons of Vienna’s rich cultural life. But when the \"Mayerling\nincident” scandal hits her and she discovers that her beloved grandfather, Emperor Franz\nJoseph I, may be responsible for the tragic death of her own deeply missed father, crown\nprince Rudolf. As shocked as the rest of her generation, Erzsi loses faith in her grandfather.\nShe revolts and takes her rebellion a step further than her famous grandmother, Empress\nSissi, notorious for her solitary travels, poetry, starvation, and tenacious quest for eternal\nyouth and beauty. Erzsi violates imperial custom by refusing to marry Archduke Franz\nFerdinand and forces the Emperor to allow her a morganatic marriage, thus contributing\nsignificantly to the Monarchy's disintegration. After WWI, a devastated Vienna is plagued by\nhunger, typhoid, and the Great Flu epidemic. Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the emperor\nhave died, and with them the Monarchy. Erzsi, however, does not mourn. She and her new\nlover see a chance for rebirth, a bright future amidst the ruins: Socialism. At Vienna's May\nDay procession, a resilient Erszi throws red carnations from a limousine and becomes “the\nRed Princess.” But Erszi is too much of a royal to represent the people’s cause, and too\nmuch of an “idealist punk” to be accepted by the new aristocracy. And while she dreams of a\n&quot;Red Vienna,” Erzsi must face the fall of her beloved city as a new leader rises - Adolf Hitler.",

    "synopsis": "Los Angeles, late ‘40s. Our heroine is a young woman at the peak of her career in the movies. However, under all the glamour and fame, she feels trapped into a patriarchal system which concedes her no artistic freedom. But her life is destined to change when she stumbles upon an unknown European film screened in a small, dilapidated cinema: the rawness of its story, the genuineness of its images, are nothing she’s ever seen in Hollywood. Captured and irreparably fascinated, she will soon make a choice that will forever change the course of her career: to leave behind all the glitz of her life in America, and travel to Europe to meet the director who brought to life such an unrecognised masterpiece.\n",
    "directorsNote": "The film will center on the romantic tribulations of our two protagonists, caught in a web of guilt, desire and escape. There is an austere beauty to the story. We want to capture the  adventure  and  challenge  of  our heroine’s  journey  –  what  could  make  a woman of 1940s Hollywood sacrifice her fame, fortune and marriage? Was it love for a man, or the artistic freedom he offers? Or is she, in fact, escaping something she wasn’t prepared to confront?\n\nOur heroine tries to take action, follows her desires in a world where women were restricted, judged and often forced into conformity. Breaking from the expectations of how she should conduct herself takes bravery and determination. There are pertinent similarities to now, with the shift towards greater representation of diversity, and the #MeToo movement. Our film prefigures some of these issues and sensibilities. Can a woman break with the system and thrive? Can she do what men have done for years and not be destroyed? \n",

There she meets a charismatic European man, thinking she has found salvation, peace, and love in him. But it turns out to be fatally wrong. Her fate is shown through a lens of Lebanese events, her experiences, internal tragedy, rejection of her religion, loss of loved ones, deception, betrayal, recovery and hope. The originality of the idea comes from our story being told through a prism of a Middle Eastern country. The project participated in Marche du film Proof of Concept pitch",

    "synopsis": "Carol of the Bells is a story about three families – Ukrainian, Polish, and Jewish – and how they lived in the same house in the city of Stanislaviv in 1938-1944. When the Soviets and Nazis occupied the city the Jews and Poles were banished or executed. The Ukrainian music teacher managed to save her neighbours’ children and her own daughter at the expense of her life. The story is told through the memories of Teresa, a famous New York singer who once was the Polish girl saved by the music teacher. She recalls these events on Christmas night while waiting for the flight of Yaroslava – the Ukrainian girl with whom they survived the war together. The only thing that Teresa has from those days is the Ukrainian song – Shchedryk (the original song that Carol of the Bells is based on). Now, she dreams of singing it together with Yaroslava.",

In a medieval world, where people look for signs of God or the Devil in everything, Melchior’s detective work appears to be truly magical. Melchior has a knack for noticing traitorous details and understands the darkest desires of the human soul. He knows, better than anyone else, that sin is waiting at the door, and temptation can poison even the most noble of intentions.",

His\nonly way of communicating is through dance.\nShe: a woman who can’t stop using her fists instead of her words. She takes care of\nthem both. Her only way of communicating is through violence. Despite being\nhomeless, they aim for another life. Poverty is what stands between them and a\nchance for a brighter future. Their desperation for something as simple as new shoes\nand a roof over their heads lead them into the criminal “Import-Export” industry.\nThings take a radical turn when the merchandise they’re supposed to transport turns\nup in the form of two young girls. They are now forced to make a decision: do they\nbecome the people they used to fear? Or do they return to the streets where they\nmight end up having to sell themselves in order to survive?\nWe follow the Twins during two intense days where all our notions of self-evident\nmorality are turned upside down.",

When he arrives at the doctor's house, the local police chief advises him not to wait too long with visiting his new patients. These visits all become extremely remarkable as they immediately tell him their innermost secrets. Even the nature surrounding Fall seems to behave weirdly. But no matter how bizarre his new environment is, Doc finds the calm he was looking for. Until one day he makes a gruesome discovery at home and the story takes a very dark turn. What once seemed as a peaceful place now turns out to be a pitch black retreat where no one is innocent.\n",

In desperate need of money, Lucija begins working for a warmhearted pro-life\nactivist Anđela, which puts Lucija’s relationship with her best friend and lover Maja to the test.\nWhen Iva gets pregnant and reluctantly decides to have an abortion, the gap between the\ngirls widens and the time comes to take responsibility; to reassess their beliefs and values, to\ngive up jobs or boyfriends, and as in Ruža’s case, to face their buried traumas. Challenged to\nsustain their lifestyle, they fear not only the loss of ownership of their body, but even more so\nthe loss of each other.",

The hotel serves as a home for spies, counter-espionage, celebrities and small-time\ncrooks. We see all this through the eyes of Ivan the green bellboy who has bigger plans that\nwe would expect.\nThe officer of the internal counter intelligence, the crooked comrade Thoman wants to\nbecome the Manager of the hotel, a position filled by the counterspionage officer, the\ncompliant communist Mrs Gyenes. As they both appreciate Ivan's excellent memory and\nobservational skills, they both want to use him for their own goals.\nThe thing everyone in the hotel seem to have in common is opportunism. And Ivan is no\ndifferent in the beginning, so he sees becoming an informant as an opportunity. Parallel to his\ngrowing love for the waitress, Ildi, he begins to see the true colors of the system. By the end\nhe learns not to care only about himself as he turns on his control officer.",

    "synopsis": "Seven young people (16-18 years old) living in a metropolis, united by a common secret,\nbegin a game where everyone has a role to play. In the world of play, in the middle of Taiga,\nin an ancient Scythian mound, there are mutants who have not been spared by an ecological\ndisaster. Many years ago, they left the big world, seeing it as a danger to their children, who\nwere growing up different from others. The children brought up in the mound have preserved\nthe cultural traditions of their people, but they speak and think in many languages,\nunderstanding the diversity and richness of the world. Their lives remain closed to others.\nThe overwhelming desire to be truly happy inspires Polina (17) to devise rules of the game\nand offer them to the others. It soon becomes clear that the game does not obey the rules, and\nfictional heroes are as unhappy as their creators. Events in the game offer the heroes a\ndifficult and the only way to happiness – to overcome the silence they have been condemned\nto since their childhood and talk about the secret that unites their destinies.",

After the death of the second new-born child the couple obediently get back to their chores to get ready to lengthy and exhausting winter. The local Yakut ruler orders the family to admit to their house the Russian political convict Kostya. The worlds of the family and the Russian unwelcome quest are colliding from the first days due to completely polar backgrounds. Despite the mutual challenge of the household against surrounding wild nature, Kostya gradually settles in and claims the position of the master of the house.",

Following a series of increasingly unsettling breadcrumbs she believes that her son might still be alive in a parallel universe. As Katie's obsession grows, her relationship with her husband Noah, who's also struggling with the loss, falls apart. With nothing to lose Katie follows Joel’s footsteps and performs the ritual.\nAfter waking up she sees signs that she's traveled into a universe where her son is still alive. Things also seem to be back to normal with her husband. But, just as life seems to be going well, it again falls apart, as she struggles against slipping back into her universe - the reality she dreads.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "In 1935, the former silent cinema and theatre star in Germany, Marija Leiko, goes to\nthe Soviet Union to take over the care of her granddaughter. The way back to Latvia\nleads through Moscow where her former friends, revolutionaries of 1905, now\ncommissars of the Stalinist regime, talk her into staying in Moscow to perform with\nthe Latvian theatre. Soon enough she becomes aware of the schizophrenic and\nviolent character of the new regime. Leonīds Zakovskis, deputy head of the NKVD,\nbecomes her admirer and romantic suitor. A year later, the NKVD-organised\n“national operation” begins, and Zakovskis is put in charge of it. Should the actress\nadmit to anti-Soviet activities, it would prove the Latvian disloyalty to the regime.\nAlbeit in the dark about the fate of her granddaughter, kidnapped by the NKVD,\nLeiko cannot admit to “crimes” she has not committed. She is forced to play her life’s\nmost tragic role – an innocent victim, along with thousands of other Latvians in\nSoviet Russia.",

Or at least this is how our\nprotagonists feel like. It’s a story about seven very different teenagers troubled by\ndifferent problems that learn to accept each other and become friends. But, the newly-\nformed crew that values open-mindedness and acceptance of differences, clashes with\nmisjudgments and prejudices of others: at school, at home, at their neighborhoods and\ncommunities…\nEach episode faces the crew with even bigger and harder challenges, learning that even\nfailure can be a valuable experience. In the final two episodes of the show, a tragic event\nchanges them forever – for better or for worse – who knows… since the show ends with a\ncliffhanger.",

There is only one pair of skis and the\nguide leaves the bishop promising to return. The bishop is sure that the guide is\ndeceiving him because he is a savage who refuses to accept Orthodoxy.",

    "synopsis": "Hans is a failed writer, 53 years old, on the verge of suicide, who has given up on writing and, after a series of interviews, finds a job in an insurance agency and also helps part-time a friend for social services. One day, while sorting through the things of his recently deceased mother, he discovers he is a distant descendent of Hans Christian Andersen. From that day forward his assiduous reading and constant research revive in him his lost imagination and the possibility of returning to his writings. Life begins to present him with real people who strangely seem to have stepped out of the pages of his great-grandfather and who, even more than before, claim their right to life. A refugee called Sirenetto/Merman, a little girl from the Roma community who sells drugs and matches, a legless soldier recently returned from Syria, a Trans-gender friend, a dancer from the TV who wears red shoes and wants to be famous, a young extremist from the Black Bloc...From each encounter, some violent, some not, but all challengingly difficult, at one point Hans begins to think they are figments of his imagination but each one opens his eyes to a different reality and enables him to go ahead with his ‘rebirth’ as a man and as a writer. The stories and the characters merge and when, eventually, Hans gets over his personal crisis he believes he is unable to find any of them. It is as if they have returned to the pages of Andersen’s stories or to the new ones that Hans has written. But life will respond differently.\n",

    "synopsis": "Welcome to a forgotten corner of Bohemia. Poverty is rife and local inhabitants often struggle\nwith debt and property seizures. Enter Hugo & Co, a law firm intent on championing those\nrobbed or cheated by loan sharks and financial predators.\nFallen aristocrat Hugo – a brilliant legal mind, but flawed genius with an impenetrable moral\ncode – is released from jail. Unable to practise in court, he hires Žofie, a sharp, idealistic\n– and pregnant – young lawyer. Her alluring empathy and idealism set the stage for a\nstruggle with the diffident Hugo. A reluctant Robin Hood, misanthropic Hugo says his\nbusiness is “not a bleeding-heart charity”. But, as they win one case after another, Hugo and\nŽofie come to realise that the curtain is about to rise on the identity of the puppet master\nbehind the financial machinations, and he is closer than they could ever imagine.\nEach episode is built around a classic legal procedural drama, in which Hugo and Žofie\nunravel an individual case, often inspired by true events that resonate with a Czech and\ninternational audience. Characters include an intrepid reporter and the estranged son of the\npuppet master, supporting the larger story throughout the series as our main characters’ fight\nwith the local oligarch reaches its climax.",

If they want to return back to the city, they have to play a teambuilding game and find the culprit. For the game’s sake everyone’s mobile phones are confiscated. There is no internet access either. \nA whirlwind of calamitous events ensues: the cabin caretaker gets fatally wounded, a snowstorm cuts the road off, and their phones are nowhere to be found. After the snowstorm passes, the self-absorbed lawyers realise they have become dependent on the only other human being around - a mysterious Foreigner. Slowly the power and status hierarchy starts to shift and break down. But who is the thief? We’re in for a shocking and poignant surprise.\n",

Jeremy treasures his childhood Walkman recordings of Serena and vows to kill Teppei Hamazaki on tape on the anniversary of her murder, in tribute. Hamazaki, once a profitable cult figure, is now a destitute recluse. Jeremy poses as a crime book researcher and hires ambitious guide Hana. As Hana helps Jeremy get closer to realizing the brutal revenge fantasy playing out in his mind, her kindness awakens a sense of normality in him for the first time. Financially desperate, Hamazaki schemes for a media blitz on the anniversary. When they come face to face, chaos ensues but Jeremy’s vengeance ultimately takes an unanticipated form.",

Despite the\npolice suspecting a known gang of thieves to be the perpetrators of the crime, the\ncase, under pressure from the right-wing political circles, takes a grotesque turn: the\nprevailing line of enquiry becomes that of a ritual murder, allegedly committed by\nfanatical Jews. And a lowly clerk named Menahem Beilis is charged with murder on\nthe basis of circumstantial evidence, and the trial is held in 1913. \nThe main character of our story is Vera Cheberyak. She is not an essentially bad\nperson, but circumstances make her become a dealer of stolen goods. She wants to\nhave a different life, but how can you overcome your destiny? Then a new figure,\nVaska the Switchman, enters the scene, she’s attracted to him – both as a man and\nas a symbol of hope for a better life. Even though she suspects him of being a police\nagent, Vera lets him inside her gang. But at the decisive moment, she chooses\ngetting stuck in the groove and finds herself trapped, as one crime leads to another.\nThe character of the police investigator Vasily Dmitrievich, whom we first meet as a\ncriminal known as Vaska the Switchman, is partially based on the story of a real\npolice detective Krasovsky, the investigator in the Yushchinsky case. Their love/hate\nrelationship lies at the core of the film.",

Magic, art and belief are fading in the\ncommunity, as their connection to traditions is lost or harnessed for selfish purposes.\nWe hear whispers of longings, exploring sexuality and playfulness across\ngenerations, but it is grief, ambition and fatalism that drive events to a final reckoning\nwith nature itself. BIWA mirrors eight stories from the Japanese art tradition.\nArchetypes of our twelve characters unfold, as each view is interrupted, only to flow\ninto the next, with characters fluidly exchanging places. Hanake, our teenage\nnarrator, is present throughout. Her mindspace, shaped by children’s play but\nshifting toward adult needs, brings the archaic community into focus and casts it in\nconflict with modernity. Innocence is lost and much more is abandoned along with it.",

Seems like a job that couldn’t possibly exist. It is a job done by millions of people every day: mothers. Then there are those mothers who, out of necessity or out of a desire for independence and personal fulfillment, also have a job outside the home. And so, the fatigue, stress, anxiety increase and amplify. Feeling anxious yet? Well, now let&#39;s raise the stakes. Some of them do both jobs by themselves. They are single mothers, the ones for whom the word ‘multitasking’ seems to have been invented. #MALAMAMMA is a series that explores the idea of maternal resistance. 2 mothers, Alice and Mia. 2 daughters, Anita and Matilde. Are we ready for new family models? Can you become a good mother without losing the woman inside you?",

All night they discuss, fight and reconcile, learning new and sometimes scary details of their friends and about their own lives. They raise the kind of questions that occur to all modern people at some point and discuss some of the more painful topics in the history of Germany, the USSR, and modern Russia. Faced with the knowledge that he needs to grow up very quickly, Philip tries to understand who he is, what his place is in the world, how he should navigate in this new reality, and formulate new principles for his life.\n",

    "synopsis": "Biniam (18) is a promising Eritrean cyclist who dreams of becoming an international pro.\nExperts grant him a great future in international cycling, but in general we don’t see too many\nriders of colour in our pro tours. Europe is not in a hurry to grant Eritreans a visa, fearing\nthey will disappear as refugees. With the support of his family, friends and teammates,\nBiniam fights against the social, physical and administrative obstacles he encounters along\nthe way. Over two years, we follow Biniam’s evolving performances during the big African\ntours where he catches the attention of major European teams, which eventually results in a\nEuropean pro team. Will we soon see Biniam at the start of a major European race, or is\ntalent simply not enough?\nDirector Lieven Corthouts has lived and worked in the Horn of Africa for fifteen years.\nHaving Biniam filming his own process, he makes this film in a co-creation process.",

The main character of the story,\nan almost adult Kazakh boy, Bakha (16), falls in love with a Russian-Polish girl,\nBerta (18), who, feeling ready for a relationship of a different kind, is attracted to the\nfrontman of the band from their courtyard – a Russian guy Vitka (19). And Vitka, in\nturn, does not miss a single pretty girl, while remaining officially a couple with Berta.\nAnd in this mess of a relationship, Bakha doesn’t seem to have any real force to\nfight. The age and the race abyss become an almost insurmountable obstacle for\nhim, but, nevertheless, he ends up the winner. The life around these teenagers is\npretty characteristic for the beginning of the 90’s: petty crime, theft and \"gop-stop\".",
